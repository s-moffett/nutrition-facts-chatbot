# Foods That Are Best for Migraines

Yes, there are several foods and dietary approaches that research suggests can help with migraines:

## Plant-Based Diet Benefits

According to research discussed on NutritionFacts.org, **a strictly plant-based diet can significantly reduce migraine pain**. In one study, when migraine sufferers were placed on a plant-based diet, they experienced significant drops in pain severity. The diet worked so well that "many individuals were unwilling to return to their previous diets after they completed the diet phase of the trial."

The benefits may come from the anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants in plant foods, while meat products have been reported to have inflammatory properties. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/headache-and-migraine-relief-from-foods)

## Low-Fat Dietary Approach

Reducing dietary fat, especially **saturated fat from meat, dairy, and junk food**, has shown remarkable results:
- A diet with less than 30g of fat daily resulted in a **six-fold decrease in migraine frequency and intensity**
- Participants went from three migraine attacks every two weeks down to just one a month
- There were significant decreases in headache frequency, intensity, duration, and medication intake

## Specific Foods to Include

**Green leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains** are particularly beneficial because they're rich in magnesium. While magnesium supplements don't appear to decrease migraine severity, they may reduce the number of attacks. The recommendation is 600mg of magnesium dicitrate daily, though it's best obtained through food rather than supplements to avoid side effects like diarrhea.

**Ginger** is particularly effective. Research shows that **1/8 teaspoon of powdered ginger** works just as well and just as fast as sumatriptan (Imitrex), a leading billion-dollar migraine drug, with significantly fewer side effects. Most patients went from moderate or severe pain to mild pain or completely pain-free. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/ginger-root-for-migraines)

**Caffeine** can also help when combined with over-the-counter painkillers, boosting their effectiveness at doses of about 100mg for migraines (equivalent to about three cups of tea). However, moderation is important—excessive caffeine from sources like cola can actually trigger headaches. [Source](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/headache-and-migraine-relief-from-foods)

The overall evidence suggests that a whole food, plant-based diet rich in green vegetables, combined with specific remedies like ginger, may offer significant relief for migraine sufferers.
