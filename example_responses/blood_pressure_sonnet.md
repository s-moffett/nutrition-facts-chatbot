# What to Eat to Lower Your Blood Pressure

Based on the blog content from NutritionFacts.org, here are the key dietary recommendations for lowering blood pressure:

## Eat More Potassium-Rich Foods

**Leafy greens** are particularly powerful because they provide a "double whammy" - they're high in both potassium and nitrates. According to [this article](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-to-lower-your-sodium-to-potassium-ratio), eating high-nitrate vegetables for just one week can lower blood pressure by about 4 points, and even a 2-point drop could prevent more than 10,000 fatal strokes every year in the United States.

Other excellent high-potassium foods include:
- **Bananas** - Just getting the minimum recommended daily intake of potassium might prevent 150,000 strokes every year
- **Sweet potatoes and baked potatoes**
- **Beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils**

## Reduce Sodium Intake

As explained in [this post](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-to-lower-your-sodium-intake), reducing salt consumption by just 15% could save millions of lives. The research shows that cutting salt intake by half a teaspoon daily could prevent 22% of stroke deaths and 16% of fatal heart attacks.

**Key strategies:**
- Avoid processed foods (which contain about 75% of dietary sodium)
- Don't add salt to your food
- Be aware that chicken is a major sodium source due to salt and additives injected into the meat

## Follow a Plant-Based Diet

According to [this article](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/what-to-eat-to-cure-high-blood-pressure), those eating strictly plant-based diets have blood pressures averaging around 110 over 65. The research shows:

- Vegetarians cut their risk of high blood pressure in half
- Those eating meat-free, egg-free, and dairy-free diets may have **75% lower risk**

## Specific Powerful Foods

As detailed in the [blood pressure treatment article](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/what-to-eat-to-cure-high-blood-pressure):

- **Ground flaxseeds** - Just a few tablespoons daily were 2-3 times more potent than aerobic exercise programs
- **Raw vegetables** work better than cooked (though both help)
- **Hibiscus tea** has shown benefits

## The Science Behind It

The reason these foods work is that potassium increases nitric oxide release, which improves artery flexibility and function, while sodium reduces nitric oxide release. As explained [here](https://nutritionfacts.org/blog/how-to-lower-your-sodium-to-potassium-ratio), when we evolved, we ate ten times more potassium than sodium - now that ratio is reversed, which is a major contributor to high blood pressure.

## Bottom Line

For optimal blood pressure control, focus on a whole-food, plant-based diet rich in leafy greens, beans, sweet potatoes, and other potassium-rich foods, while avoiding added salt and processed foods. This dietary approach can be more powerful than blood pressure medications, according to the research cited across these articles.
