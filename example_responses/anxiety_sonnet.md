# Yes, There Are Foods That Can Help With Anxiety

Based on the research presented by Dr. Michael Greger, there is evidence that **diet can significantly impact anxiety and mood disorders**.

## Plant-Based Diets Show Positive Effects

According to research discussed in "Boosting Moods with Foods," **people eating plant-based diets tend to have healthier mood states—experiencing less tension, anxiety, depression, anger, hostility, and fatigue**[1]. 

In one controlled study, removing meat (including fish and poultry) and eggs from the diet **improved several mood scores in just two weeks**[1].

## Why Plant-Based Foods Help

Several mechanisms may explain these benefits:

### 1. **Better Antioxidant Status**
Vegetarian diets provide better antioxidant status, which may help with depression and anxiety[1].

### 2. **Carbohydrates Boost Mood**
Consumption of carbohydrate-rich meals can improve depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, and fatigue. Research showed that **high-carb, low-fat diets resulted in sustained improvements in mood compared to low-carb diets**, with participants experiencing less anxiety, anger, hostility, confusion, and better vigor[1].

### 3. **Elimination of Inflammatory Compounds**
Plant-based diets eliminate **arachidonic acid**, an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid found primarily in chicken and eggs that can adversely affect mental health through neuroinflammation. High levels have been associated with greater likelihood of suicidal risk and major depressive episodes[1].

## Long-Term Results

A 22-week study of employees following a whole food, plant-based diet showed:
- **Significant improvements in mental health, vitality, and emotional well-being**
- Greater diet satisfaction despite no restrictions on portion sizes
- Improved productivity and quality of life
- Significant improvements in **depression, anxiety, and fatigue**[1]

## Nutrient-Dense Foods to Focus On

The healthiest, most nutrient-dense foods include:
- **Vegetables, herbs and spices**
- **Fruits**
- **Legumes** (beans, lentils)
- **Whole grains**
- **Nuts and seeds**

These foods "contain not only essential vitamins and minerals but also hundreds of naturally-occurring phytonutrients that may protect against cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, and other chronic health conditions"[2].

## Bottom Line

**A whole food, plant-based diet appears to be an effective, side-effect-free approach to improving anxiety and mood disorders**. As Dr. Greger notes, "Lifestyle interventions have an increasingly apparent role in physical and mental health, and among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets"[1].
