# What to Eat When You're Feeling Down

I'm sorry to hear you've been feeling down lately. Research shows that diet can significantly impact mood, and there are several evidence-based dietary strategies that may help:

## Key Dietary Recommendations

**Eat More Fruits and Vegetables**
Studies show that consuming fruits and vegetables can improve mood within days. Research found that people who ate 7-8 servings daily reported the highest life satisfaction and happiness. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they felt "calmer, happier and more energetic," with these positive effects carrying over to the next day. You need approximately 7-8 daily servings to notice meaningful mood changes.

**Consider a Plant-Based Diet**
People eating plant-based diets tend to have healthier mood states with less tension, anxiety, depression, anger, hostility, and fatigue. In one study, removing meat (including fish and poultry) and eggs improved mood scores in just two weeks. A 22-week corporate study found that participants on a plant-based diet experienced significant improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue, emotional well-being, and daily functioning.

**Focus on Carbohydrate-Rich Foods**
Consuming carbohydrate-rich meals can help boost serotonin, the "happiness hormone." Research shows that carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor meals improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, and fatigue scores. Good sources include seeds (sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin), which have a high tryptophan-to-protein ratio.

**Include Dark Leafy Greens**
Vegetables, especially when eaten 3+ times per week, appear to cut odds of depression by more than half. They contain phytonutrients that may act as natural monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which work similarly to some antidepressant medications but without the side effects.

## Why This Works

The mood-boosting effects may be due to:
- **Vitamin C** in fruits and vegetables helping produce dopamine
- **Antioxidants** reducing brain inflammation
- Eliminating **arachidonic acid** (found primarily in chicken and eggs), which may cause brain inflammation
- Plant **carbohydrates** helping tryptophan reach the brain to produce serotonin

## Bottom Line

Aim for at least 7-8 servings of fruits and vegetables daily, emphasize whole plant foods, and consider reducing or eliminating animal products. These changes can show benefits within days to weeks.

Of course, if you're experiencing significant depression, please also consult with a healthcare professional for comprehensive care.
